# no-mpu

Is a business website (of course without real content).

The page is created with Bootstrap.

I used scss (sass) to custom style the page and the behaviour.

After the final layout was created, I developed some JavaScript behaviours

- Smooth-scroll
- Scroll-spy
- Google Maps
- Navigation behaviour
